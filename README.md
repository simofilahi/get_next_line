# Get Next Line

## Overview

Get Next Line is a C programming project that involves creating a function which reads and returns one line from a file descriptor at a time. This project is a common assignment in coding education programs like 42 School, designed to deepen understanding of static variables, file descriptors, and dynamic memory allocation in C.

## Features

- Efficient handling of multiple file descriptors simultaneously.
- Utilization of static variables to maintain the state between function calls.
- Error handling to manage different read scenarios and buffer sizes.

## Getting Started

To compile and test the function:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simofilahi/get_next_line.git
cd get_next_line
make
